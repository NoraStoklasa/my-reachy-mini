# Reachy Robotics

This is my simple personal experimenting repository with a Reachy Mini robot.

## Scripts

### `hello.py`

A basic control script that demonstrates robot movements:

- Creates head poses with different roll angles
- Commands the robot to move its head and antennas
- Performs coordinated movements with body yaw control

Run with:

```bash
python hello.py
```

### `yes_no.py`

Experiments with head gesture animations:

- `say_yes()` - Tilts head up (pitch movement)
- `say_no()` - Shakes head left and right (yaw movement)
- Demonstrates basic animation sequences with position transitions

Currently includes commented sections for the "no" gesture and notes for adding antenna movements.
